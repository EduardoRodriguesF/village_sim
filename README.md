# Village Simulation

⚠️ WIP

This project aims to be a collection of systems to create a rich civilization simulation for games using the [Bevy engine](https://bevyengine.org/).

You can view the development progress at this [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/EduardoRodriguesF/projects/4/views/1).

If you have any idea or suggestion to enhance the project, feel free to open an issue :)

## Running the project

In teory, this should be as simple as running `cargo run` with your preferred target. However, I use WSL and am going through a problem that I am not sure others would experience.

If you see any error message related to the *assets* folder at the moment you run it, try copying the folder to the `targets/<target>/debug/` directory.
